# NestHub

## Idea Description
This is a peer to peer off campus housing website that connects potential roommates with room owners based on communities, preferences, and multimedia. There will also be a swipe functionality for Approval and Rejection of the user profile, and a rating system for each profile.

## UML Diagram
The UML diagram has been attached below. <br>

## User Requirements
Based on the UML Diagram, it is clear that the user begins with a registration and verification. <br>
They can register as a room finder or a room poster. <br>
The authentication for the specific roles will be conducted. If the user is a room poster, they can access the 'Room Poster' profile, and if they are looking for rooms, they can access the 'Room Finder' profile.<br>
The Room Finder profile helps the user add/edit personal details, preferences such as food, locality (distance from university), 
and rent. They can also filter out rooms based on these preferences.<br>
They will then get a list of available rooms/places, and relevant data based on their preferences.<br>
The Room Finder profile can then swipe left or right based on their choices.<br>
The Room Poster creates a similar profile with personal details and preferences for the roommate they wish to have.<br>
They can add/edit details about the room, such as pictures, rent, distance from the university, surrounding grocery stores, transportation, and food preferences.<br>
Their profile is then made visible to users.<br>
They can also swipe right or left based on roommate profiles. Once both swipes are right, they will get matched. <br>
The Room Poster and Room Finder can chat using a chat functionality and make a decision to rent the room.<br>
Once the room has been rented, the Room Poster can delete the listing. <br>
The users can then rate each other to enhance connections on the platform. <br>
